### **Welcome to Lab of Natural Products Science**

Our research group, led by **Prof. Heejung Yang**, focuses on the discovery and characterization of bioactive secondary metabolites from various natural sources. We integrate classical **Natural Products Chemistry** with modern **Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomics** and **Molecular Networking** to explore the chemical diversity of medicinal plants.

#### **Core Research Areas**
* **Drug Discovery:** Isolation and structural elucidation of novel anti-inflammatory and anti-viral agents.
* **Advanced Metabolomics:** Large-scale chemical profiling using GNPS and in silico annotation tools.
* **Bioinformatics:** Applying machine learning to predict bioactivity and digitize chemotaxonomic data.
